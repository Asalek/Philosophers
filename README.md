<h1>Philosophers</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<strong>
<p>
Here are the things you need to know if you want to succeed this assignment:
 </br>
• One or more philosophers sit at a round table.
</br>
There is a large bowl of spaghetti in the middle of the table.
</br>
• The philosophers alternatively eat, think, or sleep.
</br>
While they are eating, they are not thinking nor sleeping;
while thinking, they are not eating nor sleeping;
and, of course, while sleeping, they are not eating nor thinking.
</br>
• There are also forks on the table. There are as many forks as philosophers.
</br>
• Because serving and eating spaghetti with only one fork is very inconvenient, a
</br>
philosopher takes their right and their left forks to eat, one in each hand.
• When a philosopher has finished eating, they put their forks back on the table and
</br>
start sleeping. Once awake, they start thinking again. The simulation stops when
a philosopher dies of starvation.
• Every philosopher needs to eat and should never starve.
</br>
• Philosophers don’t speak with each other.
</br>
• Philosophers don’t know if another philosopher is about to die.
</br>
• No need to say that philosophers should avoid dying!
